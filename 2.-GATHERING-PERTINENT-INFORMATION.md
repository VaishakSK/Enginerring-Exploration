The labelling material is fed into the machine from a roll. The products are then positioned correctly on the conveyor belt which triggers a sensor to activate the labelling process. A label applicator arm then moves in and applies a label onto the product. The labelled product is then moved along the conveyor belt to the next station. The labelling system is designed to ensure that each label is applied in the correct position and orientation, regardless of the speed of the conveyor belt. | Refer the figure 1Â https://youtu.be/dgxwKLsejI4
