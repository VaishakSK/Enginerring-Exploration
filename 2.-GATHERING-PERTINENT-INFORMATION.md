01 | 1323 | VAISHAK KOLHAR| AUTOMATIC DOOR LOCK | password keypad4*4 arduino uno battery wire arduino software | Pass word door lock : Automatic doors require a sensor that detects when the door needs to open. When the sensor detects a cue, it then sends a signal to the door operating mechanism. After receiving that signal, the mechanism opens the door | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LUj7gRxcqU

WIRES|  The Circuit Diagram for ESP32-CAM Faces Recognition Door Lock System is combined with an FTDI board, Relay Module, and Solenoid Lock. The FTDI board is employed to flash the code into ESP32-CAM because it doesn't have a USB connector while the relay module is employed to modify the Solenoid lock on or off.| https://youtu.be/_VOmfJ4x-Fg

BREADBOARD  | A fingerprint lock is a type of biometric lock that uses your fingerprint as a credential. To do this, the lock scans and saves each tenant's fingerprint. The lock will then use a person's fingerprint as the access credential whenever someone attempts to open the door, and will unlock if the fingerprint is a match. | https://youtu.be/p_5H-3qjmEM

BREADBOARD | With the Arduino powered on you should see the text "Program start." Tap the piezo speaker and you should see the text "knock starting" and "knock" each time you tap it. Stop for a second or two and you'll probably see "Secret knock failed" or "Door unlocked!"| https://youtu.be/meKv4BFXXto
05 | 1338 | KATYAYINI PATIL| AUTOMATIC DOOR LOCK |Arduino Uno 1.RFID-RC522 Module 2.12v Solenoid Lock 3.Relay Module 4.Hall Effect Sensor 5.10kΩ Resistor 6.Buzzer  | A solenoid lock works on the electronic-mechanical locking mechanism. When the power is applied, DC creates a magnetic field that moves the slug inside and keeps the door in the unlocked position. The slug will retain its position until the power is removed. When the power is disconnected the slug moves outside and locks the door. It doesn’t use any power in a locked state. We will use this Hall Effect mechanism to lock and unlock the door automatically. Now scan your authorized RFID card to open the door lock. The solenoid door lock will remain open until the Hall Effect sensor output is high. Now when the door again reaches near to the Hall sensor while closing, Hall Effect sensor status will change to Low due to the magnetic field (generated by the magnet attached at the door), and the lock will be closed again. |https://youtu.be/Gd5jDYrctKA|https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/arduino-solenoid-door-lock-using-rfid
